Taobao web scraping script using Python and Selenium.

**Initiall task from my Customer:**
I need you to create a script to save pictures (and videos if there are any or possible) from the taobao website.
Initially, you receive a table file in which there is a name of the position and a link, it is necessary that your script creates a folder with a name (each link has its own name), copies the photos there by link (if the format is not jpg, then you need to convert it to it, in the mobile version jpg, and in the desktop some new format) + the files should be named according to the name of the folder. 
*For example:* Let's say the name of the folder is: Loft Industry - Glass Sky, then the files in the folder are called like this: loft_industry_glass_sky1_led7, loft_industry_glass_sky2_led7, etc.
